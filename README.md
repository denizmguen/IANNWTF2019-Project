# IANNWTF2019-Project
Final Project for IANNWTF2019. We implement the DDPG Agent from "Contunous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Lillicrap, 2015).

## Complete Notebook
The file "notebook_complete.ipynb" contains all the code as well as detailed explanations for this project. It is functional on its own. 

## DDPG.py
This file contains two classes:
  * The ReplayBuffer
  * The DDPGAgent

The explanations are sparse and the file itself not wrapped within external code does not do much.
