# IANNWTF2019-Project
Final Project for IANNWTF2019. We implement the DDPG Agent from "Contunous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Lillicrap, 2015).

## Complete Notebook
The file "notebook_complete.ipynb" contains all the code as well as detailed explanations for this project. It is functional on its own. 

## Lite Notebook
The file "notebook_lite.ipynb" is a heavily comprised version of the complete notebook. It features high level explanations as well as some code snippets for the critical parts and visualizations of the result. It is not functional on its own. 

## DDPG.py
This file contains two classes:
  * The ReplayBuffer
  * The DDPGAgent

The explanations are sparse and the file itself not wrapped within external code does not do much.

## Report 
Resembles the lite notebook but is in pdf form for compatibility
